# EM_LRG_SHARKS
Project to examine how well EM systems detect large sharks, and the development of methods to use automated video review to improve catch estimates.

This project has four objectives:
1) Evaluate alternative methods for the collection of size data by at-sea observers for large animals that can not be brought onboard
2) Examine utility of self-reported catches to validate EM sytems and evaluate EM's ability to detect sharks
3) Develoment of species Id and size measurment algorithms
4) integration of the above into the total catch accounting for sharks
