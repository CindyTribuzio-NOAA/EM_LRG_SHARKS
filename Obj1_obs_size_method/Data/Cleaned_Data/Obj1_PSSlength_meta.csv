cruise,Observer Special Project,ODDS applied observer cruise number (Observer Declare and Deploy System)
permit,Observer Special Project,Vessel permit
year,Observer Special Project,year
observer,Observer Special Project,"name of observer, should link to cruise in FMA databases, however depends on who lead observer was and which observer filled in data form"
vessel_name,Observer Special Project,name of vessel
gear_desc,Observer Special Project,gear type
haul_date,Observer Special Project,date of start of haul
haul,Observer Special Project,Haul number within that trip
size_est,Observer Special Project,"Categorical size determined by observer using visual cue, not recorded on all observations"
visual_cue,Observer Special Project,"observers were provided with a list of lengths that they could use to estimate size of shark and place into size_est categories, see sampling plan"
total_haul_pss,Observer Special Project,Total number of PSS observed in haul
census,Observer Special Project,Y/N if the observer had access to all PSS in haul
sex_obs,Observer Special Project,sex as recorded by observer on special project
photo_taken,Observer Special Project,"Y/N if the observer took any pictures, we use this to track them down later"
wt,Observer Special Project,"weight in kg (note that this will be modified in the 2023 plan to specify ONLY measured lengths, some of these are likely table weights)"
pcl,Observer Special Project,pre-caudal length (note that this will be modified in 2023 plan to take both PCL and TL because some observers recorded TL)
specimen_yn,Observer Special Project,"Y/N if a specimen was collected (i.e., eyes)"
specimen_num,Observer Special Project,"if yes, specimen numbers"
